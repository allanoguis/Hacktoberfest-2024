### PR Guidelines

**1. Write Small, Focused PRs**

- **Keep it Small**: Aim to create small, focused pull requests that fulfill a single purpose. [Smaller PRs are easier and faster to review and merge, and they reduce the risk of introducing bugs1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

**2. Review Your Own PR First**

- **Self-Review**: Before submitting, review, build, and test your own pull request. [This helps catch errors or typos that you might have missed1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

**3. Provide Context and Guidance**

- **Clear Titles and Descriptions**: Write clear titles and descriptions for your pull requests so that reviewers can quickly understand what the PR does. [Include the purpose of the PR, an overview of what changed, and links to any additional context such as tracking issues or previous conversations1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).
- **Guidance for Reviewers**: If your PR consists of changes to multiple files, provide guidance to reviewers about the order in which to review the files. [Recommend where to start and how to proceed with the review1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

**4. Use Pull Request Templates**

- **Standardize Information**: Use pull request templates to standardize the information included when someone creates a PR in your repository. [This can include a list of tasks to complete before merging1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

**5. Link to Issues**

- **Reference Issues**: Include an issue reference in your PR body to automatically close the issue when the PR is merged. [This helps keep your project organized1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

**6. Communicate Clearly**

- **Feedback Requests**: Share the type of feedback you need. [For example, specify if you need a quick look or a deeper critique1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).
- [**Ask Questions**: If you’re unsure about something, ask questions in the PR description to get the necessary feedback from reviewers2](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/).

**7. Test Thoroughly**

- [**Automated and Manual Testing**: Ensure your changes are thoroughly tested, both manually and with automated tests, to catch any potential issues before the PR is reviewed1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

> [!TIP]
> For major changes or UI changes, please include a screenshot on how it looks like on your end.
> It'll make the review faster for easier and faster pull merges.

Happy Hacking!
